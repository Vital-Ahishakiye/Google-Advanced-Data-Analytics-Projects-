# Project 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
In this project, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed on the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) dataset. The primary aim of EDA is to uncover underlying patterns, identify anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions through visualizations and summary statistics.

The EDA provides insights into key features such as trip distance, fare amount, passenger counts, and more. This analysis helps inform subsequent modeling tasks, such as regression and classification.

## Objective
The objectives of this EDA are to:
1. Identify trends and patterns in the dataset.
2. Detect and handle outliers or anomalies in the data.
3. Visualize key relationships and distributions of variables.
4. Gain insights for model-building purposes.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For data manipulation and statistical analysis.
  - Libraries: `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
- **Tableau**: For advanced data visualization and interactive dashboards.
