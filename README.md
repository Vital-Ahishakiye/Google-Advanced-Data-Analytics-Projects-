# Google Advanced Data Analytics Projects

## Overview
This repository contains the results and deliverables of the Google Advanced Data Analytics course. The projects demonstrate various skills in data analysis, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), regression modeling, classification, A/B testing, and more.

### Project Structure
1. **[Project 1: Project Proposal](https://github.com/Vital-Ahishakiye/Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics-Projects-/tree/main/Project-1-Project%20Proposal)**
   - Develop a project proposal for analyzing TLC taxi fare data.
   
2. **[Project 2: Data Cleaning](./Project-2-Data-Cleaning/README.md)**
   - Clean the dataset to handle any missing or inconsistent data points using Python.
   
3. **[Project 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](./Project-3-EDA/README.md)**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and Tableau to identify trends and outliers.

4. **[Project 4: A/B Test on Credit Card Tips](./Project-4-AB-Test/README.md)**
   - Conduct an A/B test to determine if customers using credit cards tip more than those paying with cash.

5. **[Project 5: Regression Models](./Project-5-Regression-Models/README.md)**
   - Build and evaluate different regression models to estimate taxi fares and select a champion model.

6. **[Project 6: Classification Models](./Project-6-Classification-Models/README.md)**
   - Build and evaluate classification models to predict if a passenger will be a generous tipper.

7. **[Capstone Project: Employee Retention at Salifort Motors](./Capstone-Project-Employee-Retention/README.md)**
   - Build logistic regression and tree-based machine learning models to improve employee retention.
