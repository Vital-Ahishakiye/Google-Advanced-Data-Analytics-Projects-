# New York City Taxi Fare Prediction

## A Data Analysis and Regression Model for TLC Taxi Fares

## Project Background
Congrats on your new job as a data analyst at a data consulting firm called Automatidata. Automatidata works with clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a clientâ€™s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs.

### Scenario:
Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), which is responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. TLC has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered.

**Dataset Overview**:
- Data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees.
- Covers approximately 1 million combined trips per day.

**Note**:
- The story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this project are fictitious. No identification with actual persons (living or deceased) is intended or should be inferred.
- The data shared in this project has been altered for pedagogical purposes and may not be indicative of actual NYC taxi cab rider behavior.
